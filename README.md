ðŸ”ªðŸ“¦ Reverse-engineer bundled JavaScript code and bring it back to a human-friendly format.

[Try it out](https://unminify.zeabur.app/)

## Introduction

Wakaru is a collection of tools for reverse-engineering bundled JavaScript code. Think of it as "decompiler" for JavaScript. It can be used to restore code that was bundled with a bundler (e.g. [webpack][webpack], [browserify][browserify]) or transpiled with a transpiler (e.g. [Babel][Babel], [TypeScript][TypeScript], [SWC][SWC]) or Minifier (e.g. [Terser][Terser]).

## Features

### Unpacker

Converts bundled JavaScript into separate modules

Supports the following bundlers:
  - [webpack][webpack]
  - [browserify][browserify]

### Unminify

Converts transpiled code back to its readable form and restores downgraded syntaxes.

Supports the following transpilers:
  - [Terser][Terser]
  - [Babel][Babel]
  - [SWC][SWC]
  - [TypeScript][TypeScript]

See [Unminify Documentation](./packages/unminify/README.md) for the full list of supported rules.

## Motivation

Over the course of developing plugins for io games, the need to understand game logic behind minified code became a recurring challenge. Existing tools often failed to produce readable code, and were often limited to a single bundler or transpiler. This repo was created to address these issues, and provide a single tool capable of handling a wide variety of bundlers and transpilers.

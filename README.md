# Unminify Kit

ðŸ”ªðŸ“¦ An collection of jscodeshift rules to unminify your code.

## Introduction

The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the readability of the minified code.\
This is useful for you to reverse engineer without the source code.

It provides a set of rules to reverse the minification process from:
- **Most** of [babel-preset-minify](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-minify)
- **Some** of [terser](https://terser.org)
- **Some** of transpilation from [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- ... and more

## Why?

I have intermittently worked on plugins for io games for a long time.\
So reading through minified code to understand the game logic is a common task for me.

I have tried many tools to unminify the code, but none of them can meet my needs.\
Most of them cannot even beautify the code correctly. So I decided to build my own one.

## Motivation

Over the course of developing plugins for io games, the need to understand game logic behind minified code became a recurring challenge. Existing tools often failed to produce readable code, and were often limited to a single bundler or transpiler. This repo was created to address these issues, and provide a single tool capable of handling a wide variety of bundlers and transpilers.
